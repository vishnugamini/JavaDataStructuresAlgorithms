# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains various implementations of data structures and algorithms in Java. These implementations serve as examples and can be used as a reference for understanding how different data structures and algorithms work.

## Contents

The repository includes the following implementations:

- AlternateMerge.java
- ArrayStack.java
- BinarySearch.java
- BinarySearchTree.java
- BreadthFirstSearch.java
- CharFinder.java
- CircularLinkedList.java
- DepthFirstSearch.java
- DequeLinkedList.java
- DoubleLinkedList.java
- DoublyLinkedList.java
- Filo.java
- LinkedList.java
- LinkedListClass.java
- MissingRegNo.java
- QueueArray.java
- QueueLinkedList.java
- QuickSort.java
- RecursionBinarySearchTree.java
- SequentialSearch.java
- StackLinkedList.java
- alternateMergeLinkedLists.java
- binaryTree.java
- bubbleSort.java
- insertionSort.java
- mergeSort.java
- selectionSort.java

## Usage

Feel free to explore the different implementations and use them as a reference for your own projects. Each implementation is provided as a separate Java file, allowing you to easily understand and reuse the code.
